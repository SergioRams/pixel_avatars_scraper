This is a pixel art avatar web scraper built using Selenium Webdriver, only tested for Google Chrome for now.

This tool scrapes http://www.avatarsinpixels.com/ which is a free pixel avatar generator, by using the built in 
randomizer from the site one is able to download tons of avatars.

The idea behind this project is to gather data in order train a Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) to create unique 
pixel art.
